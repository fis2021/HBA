Hotel Booking Application

# General description 
This application aims to help both clients and hotels by offering them a win-win circumstance. On one side, clients can schedule their trips using the application and on the other side, hotels can advertise their business.
The variety of hotels clients can choose from are grouped by price, services, filters and reviews; the photos with the hotel rooms and amenities are also displayed. The information helps the customers decide which trip destination to pick and the intuitive interface eases the process of reserving a room.
